Hi! Im Brandon. I like long walks on the beach and have tea parties with my many stuffed animals. Of all of my stuffed animals my Elephant is my favorite. His name is Edward, all though I voted against that name. My girlfriend is the one that named him. I also haved a stuffed dog named Ruffle. He is a little longer than a body pillow, and as wide as two. I like that name very much, its goofy......I like goofy.
